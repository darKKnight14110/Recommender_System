## Personalized Recommender System for Online Courses
I have completed this project as a part of the Machine Learning Professional Certification by IBM. The project mainly includes three parts: <br />
1) Exploratory Data Analysis
2) Content Based FIltering
3) Collaborative Filtering

### Exploratory Data Analysis:
Word Cloud:<br /> ![a9df0faf-cdbd-4c6f-8651-0f6529b95287](https://github.com/darKKnight14110/Recommender_System/assets/142472592/8a9211e0-3680-4444-9842-c9e11ba8f906) <br />
Enrollment Distribution:<br /> ![84f5360d-65bd-4903-b1d8-e17e10ce6c22](https://github.com/darKKnight14110/Recommender_System/assets/142472592/d68ed356-e06b-4e94-9de3-796c87267dc7)  <br />
Top 20 Courses:<br /> ![image](https://github.com/darKKnight14110/Recommender_System/assets/142472592/5de968a7-773b-4a1d-9141-a65892c05852) <br />

### Content Based Filtering:
1) User Profile Based
2) Course Similarity Based
3) Clustering Based

### Colaborative Filtering:
1) K Nearest Neighbours based
2) Non-Negative Matrix Factorization based
3) Neural Network Embedding Based

### Results:
Lowest RMSE Score: STACKING CLASSIFIER (0.09) <br />
This Stacking classifier comprised of: SVC, KNN and Decision Tree classifiers.
